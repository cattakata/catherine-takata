Catherine Takata, a first year Masterâ€™s student in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, UC Santa Barbara, developed an early passion for the environment. As a Native Hawaiian, hands-on conservation through Kamehameha Schools taught her to respect the land and ocean. This led to a B.S. in Earth Science with a concentration in Environmental Geology from UC Santa Cruz. At Bren, Cat will specialize in Coastal Resource Management.
