      "description": "She is a passionate environmentalist with a breadth of experience in scientific research and field work. She plans to focus her geology training toward management skills for coastal and ocean issues as it relates to environmental justice and equity. Her interests include coastal science, coastal policy, and its intersection. Her hope is to integrate policy into developing technical solutions for coastal resilience and resource management as impacted by climate change. She enjoys educating students and communicating science with others. ",

      "description": "The UC Santa Cruz, Department of Earth and Planetary Science, Weber-Holt Scholarship supported her undergraduate research thesis: five weeks of geologic field mapping on topographic ArcGIS base maps. Stratigraphy, petrology, and structural analyses methodologies were used to calculate and understand the deformation processes on the Precambrian-Cambrian Poleta Fold Belt, White-Inyo Range of Eastern California. \n\nIn the lab of Dr. Christina Ravelo, Chair of the UC Santa Cruz Ocean Science Department, Cat identified and isolated delicate benthic foraminifera samples for paleo oceanographic dating. \n\nCat spent summers at the Ocean Institute, Dana Point, CA, and helped establish Girls in Ocean Science, where middle and high school students interact with women in STEM through panel discussions, laboratories, and lectures.\n",
